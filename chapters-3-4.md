# Chapters 3 and 4

## _Believe the type_

* When I first encountered Haskell's `Bool` type, I was confused by the fact
that its two possible values, `True` and `False` are spelt with initial capitals
* This made it look uncomfortably like Visual Basic
* However, `True` and `False`, it turns out are `Bool`'s two _value
constructors_
* Once I knew that it made sense
